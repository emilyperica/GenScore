\section{Team Communication Plan}
\subsection{General Purpose Communication}
The primary mode of communication for general purposes will be through Apple iMessage SMS/MMS in the team group chat.
In the event that a team member does not respond via iMessage, the secondary mode of communication will be used. This will 
be through an Instagram direct messages group chat. The primary and secondary communication channels were chosen due to their 
practicality, team members will almost certainly have their smartphone on hand, which they can use for both iMessage and Instagram 
direct messages.
A tertiary form of communication through Microsoft Teams direct messaging and/or video calls. This will be used in the event a team 
member does not respond within a reasonable time frame to primary and secondary communication methods. It will also be the main 
application through which virtual meetings will take place (both general and supervisor meetings) as it has screen sharing capabilities 
and is familiar to all team members.
\subsection{Implementation and Task Assignment}
GitHub Projects will be the primary tool used for project management related communication. A kanban board will be collectively
maintained by the team for task assignment, progress status, meeting bookkeeping, and item reviews. 
GitHub Issues will be used in tandem with the kanban board. As such, every opened issue will be required to also 
appear on the kanban board. In addition to project tasks and to-dos, issues will also be opened for every team meeting and 
every SFWRENG 4G06A/B lecture to track attendance and team contribution. There are five categories of issues that can be 
opened by the team, each having their own template: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lecture
  \item Meeting
  \begin{itemize}
    \item General team meetings
    \item Supervisor meetings
    \item TA meetings
  \end{itemize}
  \item Peer Review
\end{itemize}
The use of these templates standardize issue creation and streamlines project progression.


\section{Team Member Roles}
All listed team member roles are tenative and subject to change at the discretion of the team. Should role changes occur
team members should follow the process outlined below: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Contact all team members that are relevant to the role change.
  \item Discuss proposed changes and ensure each team member understands their new responsibilies.
  \item Notify uncontacted team members of the change and/or the overtaking of responsibilities. 
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Project Manager}
\textbf{Assignee:} Emily Perica\\

\subsection{Music Domain Expert}
\textbf{Assignee(s):} Emily Perica\\
As the expert in the music theory domain, this person will address any confusion regarding general music theory such as terminology. They will
share their prior knowledge and experience with music whether that's playing an instrument or clarifying details about the domain.\\

\textbf{Note:} Any team member roles marked with an asterisk (*) are able to be assigned to multiple people, 
have overlapping responsibilities with other roles, and/or have responsibilities are likely to be shared amongst the enrire team.

\section{Workflow Plan}

\textbf{Issue Management Workflows}\\
When creating an issue in the Capstone Kanban Board, there are two possible workflows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Meeting issue is created (using the relevant template) prior to a scheduled meeting.  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Issue is given the 'meeting' label and assigned the 'Meeting Minutes' status.
    \item The notetaker (see section 6) will add a comment to the issue, outlining the meeting minutes and action items of each attendee.
    \item Issue is closed once all action items have been addressed.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Project work issue is created using a blank issue.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Issue begins in 'To Do'
    \item One or more appropriate labels are assigned - ‘documentation’, ‘deliverable’, ‘enhancement’, ‘bug’, and potentially others as the need arises.
    \item If the issue does not have the ‘deliverable’ label AND is not time sensitive, it will be moved to ‘Backlog’.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item The issue will move out of 'Backlog' and into 'To Do' if the issue becomes time sensitive or the team has the time/resources to take it on.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The issue moves to ‘In Progress’ once it is assigned and being worked on. It may be assigned to more than one person, depending on the scope of the issue.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item At this point, an issue pertaining to the codebase will branch to the Git Workflow (below).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The issue moves to ‘In Review’ once a PR has been made and approval is requested from the team.
    \item The issue moves to ‘Done’ and can be closed once all associated tasks have been completed, including all related PRs being merged/closed.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

In addition to the above usage of the Kanban board, all course deliverables are documented as milestones in the repository and will have issues assigned as necessary. Each milestone has a due date and a description of the tasks to be completed.

The Project Manager (see section 6 for team member roles) is responsible for making issues and keeping the project on track. As well, they will run monthly backlog grooming sessions with the team to ensure any stale issues are taken care of. \\

\noindent
\textbf{Git/GitHub Workflow}\\
A new developer on the project will begin at step 1; otherwise step 1 can be skipped:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Developer may choose to fork or clone the repo. A fork is recommended so that contributors can display the project directly in their GitHub profile.
  \item Main is a protected branch - any commits must be made in a separate branch before being pushed to a PR. There is no specific naming scheme for branches.
  \item Commit and PR names will both start with ‘Issue \#: ’. This will be enforced through a GitHub Action.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Each PR will only address a single issue, but an issue may be spread out across multiple PRs.
    \item Squash commits are enforced to ensure there is a single commit per PR.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item At least one reviewer must approve the PR before it can be merged into main.\\
\end{enumerate}


\noindent
\textbf{CI/CD Workflow}\\
Actions on Push/Pull Request:
\begin{itemize}
  \item LaTeX to PDF converter
  \item Code packaged as an executable
  \item Linting
  \item Unit tests
  \item PR naming convention enforcer
\end{itemize}

Note that a PR may not be merged if any failures are present in the pipeline.

    \hline
      Mar 7/25 & V\&V Report Revision 0 \\
    \hline
      Mar 24/25* & Final Demonstration (Revision 1) \\
    \hline
      Apr \#\#/25 - TBD & Expo Demonstration \\
    \hline
      Apr 2/25 & Final Documentation (Revision 1) \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
*The demonstration should be prepared by this date, but this will not necessarily be the date of the demo itself.

Ideally, progress on a deliverable will begin at least 3 days before the previous deliverable is due (i.e., D2 work should begin on or before Sept 20). The above schedule will be enforced through the use of Milestones in the project repository, such that each deliverable (including its due date and all relevant information) is its own Milestone.
The only exception to this is the Expo Demonstration, which is not expected to require any specific issues.

Each deliverable will be split into issues based on dependencies and relevant tasks. For example, when writing this document a single issue consisted of sections 7 and 8. They both cover project management-related plans, so completing one section provides the writer with the needed knowledge to write the other section. An alternative proposed method was to create an issue for each section of the document, but the granularity of this strategy may make the document feel more disjointed to the reader.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

  Sound File Conversion & libsndfile  & A specific library that was researched and will likely be used
  for sampled sound file format conversion.\\
  \hline
  Code Formatting & Linter(s) &  Specific tools are undetermined at this stage as it is language dependent. 
  To be used with CI workflows to format code.\\
  \hline
  Testing & MATLAB unittest/automation, CMake, Unity Test, etc.  & Specific tools are undetermined, likely a unit testing framework
  that does not transcend languages (i.e. language-specific).
  \\
  \hline
  AI/ML & N/A & Will use existing libraries (pytorch, tensorflow, etc.) given the time constraint of the project, however,
  the team aims to generate our own datasets for training.\\
  \hline
  Front-End Development & HTML, CSS, JS, React Native & Languages and existing libraries deemed useful for web-based
  GUI. A framework will likely be used, in particular React Native.\\
  \hline
  UI/UX & Figma, Canva & To design and effectively prototype UI/UX elements.\\
  \hline
  Hardware & Audio Interface & An external unit for I/O of audio signals to the host device. Possible to use the host computer's 
  built-in microphone as opposed to this. \\
  \hline
  Musical Instruments & Keyboard, guitar, ukelele, etc. & Used to generate input signals.\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\endgroup
\subsection{Continuous Integration Plans}
GitHub Actions (GHA) will be used for continuous integration. They will employ automated workflows for various unit and integration tests
as well as code formatting/linting. One specific workflow that will be created is .tex to .pdf format conversion to ease documentation editing.
GHA will also ideally be used to test code coverage metrics. One of the major components of the project is the signal processing algorithm.  
Depending on the implementation details, different metrics in addition to the basic ones such as statement coverage might be used. For example, the designed algorithm 
might benefit from condition or path coverage for pitch detection.
