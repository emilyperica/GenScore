\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}
Musicians often improvise or develop complex pieces, but have difficulty sharing, expanding on, or documenting their progress. Manual note-taking is also time-consuming and prone to errors.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

The product aims to take in audio from a singular musical instrument, and after processing the data, output the sheet music representative of the audio provided. The sheet music will contain the notes, note duration, and overall time signature of the piece.


\subsection{Stakeholders}

The product is largely aimed at helping aspiring musicians who either lack the time or the theory background to document their work in a tangible written form. It may be useful for collaborating artists who need a quick way to communicate suggestions or potential melodies.

\subsection{Environment}
To use this product the user simply has to download the desktop application associated with the product, and a high-quality microphone attachment to their computer

\section{Goals}

The ultimate goal is to develop a fast, accurate sheet music generator paired with an intuitive, user-friendly interface that requires minimal effort to learn.

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
