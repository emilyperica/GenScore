\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\section{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The resulting product can handle monophonic and polyphonic input from a 
    musical instrument.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The core function of the product.
        \item Elements such as note pitch, note length, rhythm, and tempo are essential 
        for creating sheet music.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The resulting product can generate a readable and usable score that reasonably matches the 
    audio input.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item These are the minimum qualities such that the score can be played to recreate the 
            original input.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The resulting product's digitized audio and generated scores are exportable to standard file 
    formats.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To improve portability and user accessibility.
        \item Maximizes the types of devices a user may use to read their transcriptions.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The resulting product provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that adheres to 
    human-centred design principles.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Puts the user needs, capabilities, and behaviours first, which helps achieve 
        usability goals such as learnability.
        \item Enhances overall user experience.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The resulting product is downloadable and easily installed by the user.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Essential for usability.
        \item Broadens the number of users that the product can reach. A product that is difficult
        to install easily deters users.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Stretch Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Available on different platforms and devices.
    \item Allows for real-time transcription to provide user feedback while they are playing an
    instrument.
    \item Detailed and improved transcription by expanding musical context and
    structure identification (elements such as dynamics, expression, modulations, etc.).
    \item Provides optimal instrument fingering tablature for fretted stringed instruments.
    \item The resulting product is available without an internet connection.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}
A general challenge level is expected for this project. The rationale behind this selected level is due to
the limited domain knowledge required to successfully achieve the goals of this project. There are two main 
aspects of knowledge needed: music theory and signals and systems. Much of the necessary knowledge of the 
latter topic has been discussed in multiple junior level undergraduate courses and the former is either already
known by multiple members of the team or can easily be researched and understood.
As a result of the expected challenge level, two extras have been chosen:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design thinking.
    \item Usability testing.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
\end{enumerate}
